# FragmentVR-Tracker
**Issue &amp; Feature tracker for FragmentVR** available on Steam Store: (coming soon)

FragmentVR is a Utility Application for SteamVR that uses the front camera of your HTC Vive to create windows onto your surroundings from within virtual reality. FragmentVR puts each window into a cross-game SteamVR Overlay so you can create and view them while you are in any other VR game/app. FragmentVR works on SteamVR and is compatible only with the HTC Vive since it is the only HMD with an accessible front facing camera (HTC Vive Pro support is high on the to-do list though!). 

This project is still in a fledgling state and thus can be expected to contain bugs and poor UI. Your feedback is more than welcome to help smooth out the rough edges.
