FragmentVR is a Utility Application for SteamVR that uses the front camera of your HTC Vive to create windows onto your surroundings from within virtual reality. FragmentVR puts each window into a cross-game SteamVR Overlay so you can create and view them while you are in any other VR game/app. FragmentVR works on SteamVR and is compatible only with the HTC Vive since it is the only HMD with an accessible front facing camera (HTC Vive Pro support is high on the to-do list though!). 

This project is still in a fledgling state and thus can be expected to contain bugs and poor UI. Your feedback is more than welcome to help smooth out the rough edges.

Usage is straightforward, you place the bottom tip of your right controller where you want a corner of your window to be in your surroundings and pull the trigger. Once 4 corners have been placed the window appears and remains in place.

the upcoming features are the following (not necessarily in this order) :

Multiple windows
HTC Vive Pro support
Interactive UI
Modifiable windows

**NOTE: Vive front camera sometimes refuses to work on first run of SteamVR, going to Devices and clicking on Restart Vive Headset should fix this. You can check if the camera is working by going to Settings > Camera and clicking on Test Camera Rate.**
